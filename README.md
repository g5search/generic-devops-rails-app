# Generic DevOps Testing Rails App

This is a Rails app built by the DevOps team as a testbed.

Testing with our real applications can be a hassle. You need a database, you don't really know which endpoints are safe and which aren't, and you're not familiar with how they're supposed to look. This app is dead simple but will (over time) have a easy way for DevOps to test that normal Rails functionality is working.
